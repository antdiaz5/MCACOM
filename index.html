    <h3>Commitment</h3>

    <p>I enjoy the work I do and love to find more <strong>efficient</strong>ways to tackle modern challenges,</p>
    <p> I notice alot from listening and seeing, I know that when we create new job numbers, the technicians never</p>
    <p>have access to them and end up cloking in to another job number. This creates issues such as overloading a</p>
    <P> specific job numbers causing it to be over hours. Or that we cant receive material because we are on credit hold,</P>
    <p>I aim to find solutions for the following problems and more, Creating MCA's own ERP</p>
